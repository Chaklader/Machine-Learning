    "    * Strengths:\n",
    "        * It works very fast because it explicitly calculates the needed parameters, thereby not need to perform any iterations.\n",
    "        * The naive assumpution of the conditional independence of features (when it holds) allows it to model the data with high bias and hence, low variance. So, it works well with less amount of training data. In high variance models, a large amount of training data is required to reduce the error due to variance.\n",
    "        * It is a generative model (it provides a model of how data is instantiated or generated) by modeling the joint distribution of the various classes. So, it provides a greater insight into the data than discriminative models because Naive Bayes gives information about which class or category is most likely to generate the data in question.\n",
    "        * It can easily perform online updates to the model. So, if any new training data becomes available over the course of the models' use in production, the model can be easily \"fitted\" to accomodate the new training data.\n",
    "    * Weaknesses:\n",
    "        * The naive assumption of the conditional independence of features does not generally hold in practice.\n",
    "        * If the training data does not contain any occurrence of a combination of a certain attribute value and a certain class label, then the frequency-based probability estimate for that combination will be zero. In other words, this issue occurs when the training sample taken from a population is not representative of the entire population.\n",
    "    * Reasons to use this model:\n",
    "        * The amount of data is less so this model should work well.\n",
    "        * It is highly possible that one of the features contributed to the student not being able to graduate. So, the naive assumpution of the conditional independence of features can be assumed here.\n",

    "        * Random Forests have been used in Genome-wide association study, where the genomes (complete DNA sequences) of different samples have been compared to provide critical information about different diseases. This gives the suceptibility of each different individual to complex diseases as well as the response to different drugs based on the individual's genetic variations.\n",

    "    * Strengths:\n",
    "        * It has all the strengths of Decision Trees without many of their weaknesses. Due to the efficient use of the bagging technique used in Random Forests, the model has less variance as compared of individual Decision Trees which helps prevent overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "        * It has only one important parameter which needs to be tuned (the number of features to randomly select at each node), thereby making it an easy to setup model.\n",
    "        * It is fast during the training step because it can run each decision tree training in parallel.\n",
    "        * It does not require the data to be linearly separable.\n",
    "        * It can handle small or large number of features as well as small or large number of training examples very well.\n",
    "        * It provides a really good idea of which features in the dataset are the most important.\n",
    "        * It requires very little data preparation like normalization, creation of dummy variable etc. because it can work with both numerical values and categorical values.\n",
    "    * Weaknesses:\n",
    "        * If the number of trees is large, then the prediction step may be slow.\n",
    "        * It is very difficult to perform online learning. If any new training data is available, it is better to simply perform the training step again on the entire data, thereby giving a new model.\n",
    "        * It is difficult to understand the result of the learning of a Random Forest model as compared to a Decision Tree model (which follows simple boolean logic).\n",
    "    * Reasons to use this model:\n",
    "        * There are a large number of features in the provided data so a Random Forest will perform well.\n",
    "        * Random Forests are good at choosing which features are important to arrive at the prediction, thereby ignoring features which do not contribute enough to the final prediction. Out of the many features available, not all would be an important factor in the graduation rate of the students.\n",

However, this disadvantage is offset by the accuracy of the predictive power of the AdaBoostClassifier model on the current dataset. Also, the training time is less than a fraction of a second so this model is cost-effective to train with respect to the limited resources available.\n",

So, the amount of time spent trying out various values for the parameters to tune the model will be less as compared to the other two models. The GaussianNB model does not even provide any parameters to tune the model.\n",
    "* The results of the AdaBoostClassfier model may not be as easily interpretable as that of the GaussianNB (which is just a collection of class probabilities).

    "* The AdaBoostClassifier model begins by learning a list of instructions which explain the relationship of the factors in a student's life (like parents' education status, the family's financial stability etc.) to the final result whether the student has passed or failed. The list of instructions together can provide a prediction of pass or fail, based on the values of the various factors.\n",
    "* Each prediction on a student's result has some weight associated with it. This weight is used as an indicator of the importance of that particular prediction. Predictions with higher weights are given more priority than predictions with lower weight. Initially, all the predictions have equal weight. In other words, this weight is indicative of the closeness of the student's result to the results of the general population of students.\n",
    "* The model uses the above learned rules on the same data that it used during the above learning phase to see if it can predict the final result of pass or fail accurately for each student.\n",
    "* In cases where the above prediction is incorrect, it increases the weights of the incorrect predictions and then tries to make predictions again on the same data. This way, any incorrect predictions get more weightage in the next run and thus, these incorrect predictions become correct predictions on the next run of predictions on the same data.\n",
    "* The above process is repeated a certain number of times. This causes subsequent runs of the predictions to focus more on the difficult cases where it got incorrect predictions.\n",
    "* It is possible that the next run of predictions might cause an earlier correctly predicted result to be incorrectly predicted. Now, since this prediction is incorrect in the current run, it will get more weightage in the next run, thereby correctly predicting it in the subsequent runs.\n",
    "* So, the AdaBoostClassifier model iteratively corrects it's own mistakes.\n",
    "* In some ways, this is exactly how a teacher might teach a class of say, 50 students. After every test, the teacher will focus more attention in class on the students who got low marks in the previous test, to ensure that they pass the next one."
